# Hello, I'm Io

I'm a **sometimes developer** who loves learning new things, sometimes building random projects, and exploring various things.

## What I Do

I'm passionate about writing code in various programming languages and am always looking to improve my skills. Here's a quick rundown of what I work with:

- **C++**: I have a solid foundation but still exploring advanced concepts.
- **JavaScript**: I enjoy building interactive web applications and learning more about frontend development.
- **Python**: Still learning, but using it for automation, data analysis, and small projects.
- **Web Development**: Basic knowledge of **HTML** and **CSS**, always experimenting with making beautiful, responsive websites.
- **Discord Bots**: I occasionally create Discord bots, mostly for personal use or fun.

## Skills I'm Exploring

- **Design**: I'm learning about design principles and UI/UX to improve my work visually.
- **Guitar**: I'm also exploring the world of music and learning how to play guitar, it's a fun creative outlet for me.
- **AI and LLMs**: Getting into how artificial intelligence and large language models work, for fun, to use in projects and so on.

## Currently Learning

- Web frameworks like **React** and **Vue.js** to level up my JavaScript skills.
- Deepening my Python knowledge.
- Advancing my design skills with tools like **Figma** and **Adobe XD**.

## Some of My Projects

- I don't currently have any major projects, just random ones for fun (or for friends ofc).
- (My contribution graph is a bit empty because I have **no** idea what to build :P)
